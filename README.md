# Galton_Heredity_Regression_Analysis
This analysis uses the heights data collected and studied by Francis Galton to try to understand heredity.
It will essentially follow the steps that Galton used to develop regression
## Goals
- Determine correlation between data points
- Make connections between pairs of data that follow a normal distribution
- Create a regression model to predict a child’s height based on the parents’ height
- Evaluate the accuracy of the model
